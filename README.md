"# Tic-Tac-Toe" 

Dependencies: Bootstrap and JQuery


This is the traditional game of Tic-Tac-Toe that is played with 2 players. This is built using simple HTML/CSS/JS as well as JQuery and Bootstrap for styling. This was early in my bootcamp training and I built it out of pure curiosity when we started learning about DOM manipulation.
